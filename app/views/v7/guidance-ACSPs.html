      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="before">Before you start</h2>

<p>You must have completed identity checks that meet the Companies House identity verification standard. You must keep records of the checks for 7 years. We may ask for more information if we need to. </p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Read the <a href="guidance">guidance on how to meet Companies House identity verification standard</a>.

<p>You may be suspended or removed from the Companies House list of authorised agents if:</p>

      <li>you cannot provide records of identity checks when asked</li>
      <li>you have not met the identity verification standard</li>
    </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-you-need">What you’ll need </h2>

      <p>When you have completed checks to verify someone’s identity, you will need to 
use this service to tell us the:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>person’s name</li>
              <li>person’s date of birth</li>

      <p>You’ll also need to complete a declaration to confirm that the person is who they claim to be and you have completed checks that meet the Companies House identity verification standard.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="after">What happens when you verify someone’s identity </h2>


<p>If your checks meet the Companies House standard of identity verification, we will email the person their Companies House personal code. This is an 11 character code that is given to a person once they’ve verified their identity. <p>
<p>They will need to use their Companies House personal code to connect their verified identity to our records. This is so that we know the correct person is linked to the name we have on file.   </p>

<p>They can share this code with people who file on their behalf, or for their company. </p>


     


                   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="public-info">What we’ll show on the public register</h2>

      <p>Once the person has used their personal code to connect their verified identity to our records, we will show that they are verified. </p>
      <p>As part of any records about the person, we will show:</p>


            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>the name of your authorised agent</li>
              <li>the names of the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory bodies the agent is registered with </li>
              <li>the date you completed the identity checks </li>
