   <p>When you verify someone's identity for Companies House, the law requires you to meet our identity verification standard. The standard is included as part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/registrars-rules">the registrar's rules</a>. </p>

   <p>The following checks outline the minimum you must do to meet the required standard.</p>
    
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-1">Ask for information about the person </h2>


    <p>The person will need to give you their:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>full name and any former names</li>
              <li>date of birth</li>
              <li>home address</li>
              <li>address history for the last 5 years</li>
              <li>email address</li>
            </ul>  
   


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-2">Get evidence to verify the person’s identity</h2>

      <p>You’ll need to ask to see documents as evidence to verify the person's identity. There are 2 options to do this, you must use option 1 if you can. The documents you can use will depend on which option you use.  
 </p>

<!--
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
  You cannot use documents that have expired to verify someones identity. However, the person will not need to verify again if a document expires after you have completed identity checks.
</div>

      <p>Where we've included an issuing country or authority for a document, you cannot accept a foreign equivalent.</p>

 -->
<p>You cannot use:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>documents that have expired</li>
              <li>a foreign equivalent of a document, if we've specified an issuing country or authority</li>
            </ul>
    <p>The person will not need to verify again if a document expires after you have completed identity checks.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Option 1</h3>


      <p>You can only use option 1 if you have the technology to validate the documents are authentic.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#part-1-introduction-to-identity-document-validation-technology">Read the guidance on Identification Document Validation Technology</a> for information on technology that will allow you to do this. </p>

      <p>The person will need to provide <strong>1 of the following documents</strong>:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>biometric or machine-readable passport </li>
              <li>Irish passport card</li>
              <li>UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and EU photocard driving licence </li>
              <li>EU or EEA identity card, with biometric information </li>
              <li>UK biometric residence permit </li>
              <li>UK biometric residence card </li>
              <li>UK Frontier Worker permit </li>
            </ul>



      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Option 2</h3>

     
      <p>The person will need to provide <strong>2 documents in total</strong>. If they can, they must provide at least one biometric or photographic document. </p>

      <p>They can provide <strong>either</strong>:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>2 documents from group A</li>
              <li>1 document from group A, and 1 document from group B </li>
              </ul>

      
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Group A</h4>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>passport or Irish passport card</li>
              <li>EU or EEA identity card </li>
              <li>UK biometric residence permit </li>
              <li>UK biometric residence card </li>
              <li>UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and EU photocard driving licence </li>
              <li>UK HM Forces ID Card </li>
              <li>UK HM Armed Forces Veteran Card </li>
              <li>UK Frontier Worker permit </li>
              <li>photographic work permit (government issued) </li>
              <li>photographic immigration Document </li>
              <li>photographic visa </li>
              <li>UK, Channel Islands and Isle of Man firearms licence </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/en/prado-start-page.html">photographic ID listed on PRADO</a> </li>
            </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Group B</h4>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>birth or adoption certificate </li>
              <li>marriage or civil partnership certificate </li>
              <li>immigration document, visa or work permit</li>
              <li>bank or building society statement </li>
              <li>UK local authority or social housing rental agreement – this must be for the person’s current address </li>
              <li>mortgage statement - issued within the last 6 months</li>
            </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-3">Check the evidence is real</h2>
      <p>You should always check identity documents for signs of tampering. You must query if there are any signs of damage to a document, especially if it is in an area where personal details are shown. </p>

      <p>If the evidence is being checked by a person, they must trained in detecting false documents by a specialist training provider. This could be any organisation that follows the Home Office best practice guide, including: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Home Office (HO)</li>
              <li>National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU)</li>
              <li>National Protective Security Authority (NPSA)  </li>
            </ul>


      <p>Contact the issuing authority, or another authoritative source, to check if you have any concerns about a document.</p>
      <p>For documents issued by a country outside of the UK, you should contact the relevant embassy if you have concerns.  </p>

      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-4" >Check the identity belongs to the person claiming it </h2>

     <p>You’ll need to check that: </p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the documents confirm their date of birth and home address </li>
            <li>it matches other evidence or information provided by the person, if biometric evidence and technology is used</li>
            <li>the person physically matches the photo on, or related to the document </li>
            <li>the person is a real person – this is also known as a ‘liveness’ check</li>
          </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-5">Check the person’s identity has existed over time</h2>

      <p>The following steps will help you to confirm the identity has existed over time. This will lower the risk of you accepting: </p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a synthetic identity</li>
                <li>an identity that belongs to someone who has died</li>
              </ul>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check their address history</h3>

      <p>The person will need to give you their address history for the last 5 years. Where possible, you should ask to see documentation to confirm the address history.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Check if they have changed their name</h3>
      <p>You must ask the person about any previous name changes. You should ask them to show you documentation to support any changes of name.</p>
      <p>If they cannot show you proof of the name change, you should find out why and consider whether to verify their identity.</p>

       <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.	Check if they have regularly interacted with other organisations or people</h3>
      <p>To make sure the identity belongs to a real person, you should ask to see evidence of activity you would expect from someone. </p>

      <p>You could do this by:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>asking to see a bank or credit card statement to check for recent transactions</li>
            <li>asking to see utility or council tax bills for the person’s home address </li>
            <li>checking if their passport has been used recently or over time </li>
          </ul>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-6" >Tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</h2>
      
      <p>Once you have verified someone’s identity, you’ll need to use our online service to: 
        
                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>tell us the person’s details</li>
                    <li>confirm you have completed checks to verify their identity to the required standard</li>
                    </ul>

         <p>You do not need to submit copies of the documents you use to verify someone's identity. However, you must keep copies of the documents for 7 years. We may ask you for more information if we need to.</p>

      <p>Read the <a href="guidance-ACSPs">guidance on how to tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</a>.   </p>





         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="other">Other ways to verify someone’s identity</h2>
 
         <p>You can use commercial identity providers or platforms to verify someone's identity. If you do this, you must make sure the provider or platform completes checks that meet the Companies House identity verification standard.</p>
          

         <p>You can also ask people to <a href="">verify their identity with Companies House</a>. This is a free service.</p>




         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="cannot">What to do if you cannot verify someone’s identity</h2>
        <p>If you have not been able to verify a person’s identity, you will need to keep records of the evidence you used and checks you completed. </p>
        <p>It is the person’s responsibility to prove that they are who they say they are. They will need to get documents to be able to verify their identity for Companies House. </p>
        <p>They will need to verify their identity to do any of the following:</p>

             
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>file with Companies House</li>
            <li>be a director</li>
            <li>be a Person of Significant Control (PSC)</li>
            <li>apply to register as a Companies House authorised agent </li>
          </ul>
