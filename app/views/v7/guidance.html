        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-1">Ask for information about the person </h2>


    <p>You need to ask for a combination of information about the person’s identity.  </p>

    <p>You'll need their: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>full name and any former names</li>
              <li>date of birth</li>

            </ul>


   

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-2">Get evidence to verify the person’s identity</h2>

      <p>You’ll need to ask for documents to verify the information the person has given you. </p>

      <p>You must use one of following options to meet the standard. </p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Any documents you use to verify someone’s identity must be current. You cannot use documents that have expired.
</div>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Option 1</h3>


      <p>You can only use option 1 if you’re able to validate the authenticity of identity documents.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#part-1-introduction-to-identity-document-validation-technology">Read the guidance on Identification Document Validation Technology</a> for information on technology that will allow you to do this. </p>

      <p>The person will need to provide <strong>1 of the following documents</strong>:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Biometric or Machine-Readable Passport </li>

              <li>UK Frontier Worker Permit </li>
            </ul>



      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Option 2</h3>

      <p>If you cannot validate the authenticity of identity documents, or the person doesn’t have any of the documents listed in option 1, the person will need to provide <strong>2 documents in total</strong>. </p>

      <p>They will need to provide <strong>either</strong>:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Group A</h4>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Passport or Irish Passport Card</li>
              <li>EU or EEA identity card </li>
              <li>UK biometric residence permit </li>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Group B</h4>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Birth or Adoption Certificate </li>
              <li>Marriage or Civil Partnership Certificate </li>

              <li>Mortgage Statement - issued within the last 6 months</li>
            </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-3">Check the evidence is real</h2>
      <p>You should always check identity documents for signs of tampering. You must query if there are any signs of damage to a document, especially if it is in an area where personal details are shown. </p>

      <p>If the evidence is being checked by a person, they must trained in detecting false documents by a specialist training provider. This could be any organisation that follows the Home Office best practice guide, including: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Home Office (HO)</li>
              <li>National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU)</li>
              <li>National Protective Security Authority (NPSA)  </li>
            </ul>


      <p>If you are concerned by a document, you should contact the issuing authority, or another authoritative source to check.  </p>
      <p>For documents issued by a country outside of the UK, you should contact the relevant embassy if you have concerns.  </p>

      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-4" >Check the identity belongs to the person claiming it </h2>

     <p>You’ll need to check that: </p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the documents confirm their date of birth and home address </li>
            <li>if biometric evidence and technology is used, it matches other evidence or information provided by the person </li>
            <li>the person physically matches the photo on, or related to the document </li>
            <li>person is a real person – this is also known as a ‘liveness’ check</li>
          </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-5">Check the person’s identity has existed over time</h2>

      <p>The following steps will help you to confirm the identity has existed over time. This will lower the risk of you accepting: </p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a synthetic identity</li>
                <li>an identity that belongs to someone who has died</li>
              </ul>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check their address history</h3>

      <p>The person will need to give you their address history for the last 5 years. Where possible, you should ask to see documentation to confirm the address history.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Check if they have changed their name</h3>
      <p>You must ask the person about any previous name changes. You should ask them to show you documentation to support any changes of name.</p>
      <p>If they cannot show you proof of the name change, you should find out why and consider whether to verify their identity.</p>

       <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.	Check if they have regularly interacted with other organisations or people</h3>
      <p>To make sure the identity belongs to a real person, you should ask to see evidence of real activity that you would expect to see from a person. </p>

      <p>You could do this by:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>asking to see a bank or credit card statement to check for recent and usual transactions you would expect to see </li>
            <li>asking to see utility or council tax bills for the person’s home address </li>
            <li>checking if their passport has been used recently or over time </li>
          </ul>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-6" >Tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</h2>
      
      <p>Once you have verified someone’s identity, you’ll need to use our online service to tell us the person’s details. You’ll need to confirm you have completed checks to verify their identity to the required standard. </p>

      <p>Read the <a href="guidance-ACSPs">guidance on how to tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</a>.   </p>

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="other">Other ways to verify someone’s identity</h2>
 
         <p>This is guidance and if you choose to use other checks to verify someone’s identity, you must make sure you still reach the level of assurance required in the standard. This includes if you use software or a commercial identity verification service.</p>

         <p>You can also refer people to use our <a href="">service to verify their identity with Comapnies House</a>. This is a free service.</p>



         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="cannot">What to do if you cannot verify someone’s identity</h2>
        <p>If you have not been able to verify a person’s identity, you will need to keep records of the evidence you used and checks you completed. </p>
        <p>It is the person’s responsibility to prove that they are who they say they are. They will need to get documents to be able to verify their identity for Companies House. </p>
        <p>They will need to verify their identity to do any of the following:</p>

             
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>file with Companies House</li>
            <li>be a director</li>
            <li>be a Person of Significant Control (PSC)</li>
            <li>apply to register as a Companies House authorised agent </li>
          </ul>
