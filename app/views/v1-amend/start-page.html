 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’ll show on the public register </h2>  

<p>
When you verify someone’s identity, we'll ask you to confirm a statement to say you are satisfied the person is who they claim to be. </p>

<p>If the person connects their verified identity to their Companies House record as a director or person with significant control (PSC), we’ll show the statement on the public register to confirm they are verified.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="guidance-ACSPs">guidance about verifying someone's identity for Companies House</a> to find out what information the statement will include.</p>


<p>The statement will include the person’s name, as well as information about the authorised agent that has verified their identity.</p>
<p>If we should not show the person's name on the public register, you can provide another name to use for the statement. For example, you may want to do this if the name that’s shown on their identity documents is not the name they are usually known by. </p>

   <p>We'll send their personal code to the email address you provide in this service. This will be needed to connect their verified identity to our records. </p>
