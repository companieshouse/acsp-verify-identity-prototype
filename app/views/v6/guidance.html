   <!--     <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="who">Who needs to verify their identity</h2>

              <li>a person with significant control (PSC)</li>

              <li>the equivalent of a director - this includes members, general partners and managing officers</li>
            </ul>   -->


    
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how">1.	Get evidence of the claimed identity </h2>


    <p>You’ll need to know a combination of information about the person whose identity you are checking. This is known as their claimed identity. </p>

    <p>As a minimum, you must know their: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>name</li>
              <li>date of birth</li>
              <li>home address</lil>
              <li>nationality</li>
            </ul>



        <p>The person will need to show you identity documents to prove this information so you can verify their identity.</p>
     
        <p>You must keep a copy of any documents you use to check a person’s identity while you have a working relationship and for 5 years after.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Documents you can use as evidence </h2>

  <p>Depending on what documents the person can provide, there are 3 routes to verify someone’s identity. </p>
  <p>Documents must only be included once in the document count. For example, 2 banks statements from the same bank will not count as 2 separate documents. </p>
  <p>If the person is a resident outside of the UK, the documents they provide must include a government issued photographic identity document. </p>



     
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s" >Route 1</h2>
      
      <p>The person must provide <strong>one document</strong> from group A. </p>
      <p>You must use this route if the person can provide the document. </p>


      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s" >Route 2</h2>
      
      <p>You can only use this if the person cannot provide a document from group A. </p>
      <p>The person must show you <strong>2 different documents in total</strong>. It must include: </p>

       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>one document from group B </li>
        <li>a different document from group B, C or D</li>
      </ul>


    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Route 3</h3>

    <p>You can only use this if the person is a resident of the UK and does not have documents from groups A or B. </p>
    <p>The person must be able to show <strong>3 different documents in total</strong>. It must include:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>one document from group C</li>
              <li>a different document from group D</li>
              <li>a different document from group E </li>
            </ul>

    <p>You’ll also need to take a photograph of the person. If you cannot take a photograph, you must ask for a photograph and do a likeness check.</p>

    <p>We are more likely to contact you for more information if you have checked someone’s identity using this route. It provides a lower level of assurance, so you may need to verify the person’s identity again. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-2">2. Check the evidence is genuine and valid </h2>

      <p>If you want to prove someone’s identity using information that’s based on physical evidence, you must check it is genuine. This means that the evidence is unlikely to be forged or counterfeit.</p>

      <p>You must check that documents: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>are valid – this means you can find records that show the document has been issued </li>
              <li>have not been reported as lost or stolen </li>
              <li>have not expired </li>
              <li>are in the person’s name</li>
              <li>confirm the person’s date of birth and home address </li>
            </ul>


      <p>You should always check identity documents for signs of tampering. You must query if there are any signs of damage to a document. This is particularly important if the damage is in an area where personal details are shown, such as the name or photograph. </p>

      <p><a href="">Read the National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) guidance on examining identity documents</a> for more information on how you can detect basic forgeries. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking digital documents </h2>

      <p>This includes printed versions of digital documents. </p>
      <p>Digital documents often provide a lower level of assurance than physical documents. This is because physical documents that have been posted to a person’s address prove that the person has access to that address. </p>
      <p>You can accept printed versions of digital documents, but you should consider the lower level of assurance when accepting these as evidence. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking documents issued by a country outside of the UK </h2>

      <p>If you are concerned a document form outside the UK may not be genuine, you should check it by either: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>contacting the relevant embassy or consulate </li>
              <li>using the <a href="">Public Register of Authentic identity and travel Documents Online (PRADO)</a></li>
            </ul>

      <p>If documents are in a foreign language, you must check they provide evidence of the customer’s identity. The Registrar may require certified translations when inspecting your identity verification records.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-3">3.	Check the claimed identity has existed over time</h2>
      <p>This is also known as an ‘active history’ check. It lowers the risk of you accepting: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>a synthetic identity </li>
              <li>an identity that belongs to someone who has died </li>
            </ul>


      <p>You should be aware that some parts of a person’s identity may change over time, for example their name or gender. This can be for legitimate reasons so is not always a sign of higher risk.  </p>

     <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check their address history </h2>
     <p>The person will need to give you their address history for the last 5 years. Where possible, you should ask to see documentation to confirm the address history. </p>

     <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if they have changed their name </h2>
     <p>You must ask the person about any previous name changes. You should ask them to show you documentation to support any changes of name. </p>
     <p>If they cannot show you proof of the name change, you should find out why and consider whether to verify their identity. </p>
     <p>You can usually accept documents which show the person’s name as a synonym. For example, a document might say the person’s name is Samantha on their passport, but Sam on their bank card.</p>

     <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if they have regularly interacted with other organisations or people</h2>
     <p>You can check the person’s interactions over time by asking to see evidence of their: </p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>credit card activity </li>
              <li>gas or electric account payments </li>
              <li>online bank or retail account activity</li>
              <li>travel to another country</li>
              <li>health records </li>
              <li>employment records, for example payslips</li>
              <li>school records</li>

            </ul>


     <p>The person will need to give you their address history for the last 5 years. Where possible, you should ask to see documentation to confirm the address history. </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" >4.	Check if the claimed identity is at high risk of fraud </h2>

     <p>You must keep records to show you have attempted to make sure the person’s identity is not:</p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>at a higher risk of identity fraud than usual</li>
            <li>a synthetic identity</li>
          </ul>
      <p>To do this, you can check the details of the claimed identity with counter-fraud data sources, such as a national fraud database. </p>

      <p>You should make sure the person’s identity has not been stolen or reported as stolen. You can also use counter-fraud data sources to check if the identity:</p>
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>belongs to someone who is alive </li>
        <li>is known by an organisation that should have a record of that person (for example an Electoral Registration Office in a local authority)</li>
        <li>is at a higher risk of being impersonated, for example if they are a politically exposed person like a politician or judge</li>
    </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" >5.	Check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it</h2>

      <p>If possible, you should ask for biometric or photographic identity documents (or both). This is so you can compare the document with the person to check that: </p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>the person physically matches the photo on (or related to) the document </li>
                <li>the person matches the biometric information shown on the document or a trusted data source</li>
              </ul>
        <p><a href="">Read more about how you can make sure someone matches biometric information</a> in the government guidance on proving and verifying someone’s identity.  </p>

        <p>You will need to check the:</p>
                     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                        <li>documents are real</li>
                        <li>person is a real person – this is also known as a ‘liveness’ check</li>
                        <li>person is the same person as in the document photograph (also known as a ‘likeness’ check)</li>
                      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" >6.	Tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</h2>
      
      <p>When you have completed checks to verify someone’s identity, you will need to send a verification statement to the registrar. To do this, you need to <a href="start-page">Tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</a>. </p>

      <p>You needs to tell us the: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>person’s name </li>
            <li>person’s date of birth </li>
            <li>person’s home address</li>
            <li>date you completed the identity checks </li>
            <li>documents you used as evidence to verify their identity</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You’ll also need to complete a declaration to confirm that the person is who they claim to be. </p>

          <p>If your checks meet the Companies House standard of identity verification, we will send the person their Companies House personal code. </p>
          <p>They will need this to prove their verified status to (do any of the following):  </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>file with Companies House </li>
            <li>be a director </li>
            <li>be a Person of Significant Control (PSC)</li>
          </ul>

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Other ways to verify someone’s identity</h2>

         <p>You can use an identity platform or commercial provider to verify someone’s identity.</p>

         <p>If you do this, you must: </p>
                   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>ensure the checks are carried out correctly and meet Companies House identity verification standard</li>
                      <li>keep copies of documents or other evidence</li>
                    </ul>

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to do if you cannot verify someone’s identity</h2>
        <p>The person will need to get documents to be able to verify their identity for Companies House. </p>
        <p>If you cannot file annual accounts because you need more time to verify someone’s identity, you can <a href="">apply to extend the accounts filing deadline</a>. </p>
        <p>You must do this before the normal filing deadline.</p>
