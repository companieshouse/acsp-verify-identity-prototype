<p>
When you verify someone’s identity, we'll ask you to confirm a statement to say you are satisfied the person is who they claim to be. </p>

<p>If the person connects their verified identity to their Companies House record as a director or person with significant control (PSC), we’ll show the statement on the public register to confirm they are verified.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="guidance-ACSPs">guidance about verifying someone's identity for Companies House</a> to find out what information the statement will include.</p>
